I wanted to talk a little bit about Kali and why I think people are stupid with their negative opinions on it. There is some stupid egotistical thinking on the web that using an OS like Kali for Pentesting/hacking makes you a skid and an idiot or something like that. There are posts like this one that is not only showing a lack of brain cells, but shows ignorance: <a href=https://forum.wearedevs.net/t/15659>https://forum.wearedevs.net/t/15659</a></p><p>Yes you could install any old Linux install and compile, install, etc the tools yourself manually, but if you are like me you probably have a Tools folder on your machines that is over 80 GB (last I checked it was 80 GB. At one point it was over 100 GB.) and this is because I download, git clone, etc many many tools I find and read about that I test out in my labs. I also write and maintain my own tools that vary in languages and scripts. This can become extremely time consuming and tedious.</p><p>The reason why Kali was created in the first place was to help info security researches to not spend all their time compiling/installing, testing, documenting, etc tools since when Kali first became a thing, the sheer number of tools was becoming really, really large and difficult to keep track of and document. If you are like me you also spend a lot of time going through tools on GitHub. I do this a lot for OSINT tools or just trying to find something that I need for a more specific task that usually ties back to OSINT. Even I cannot keep up with all of these tools because there are just too many.</p><p>It is stupid and naive to think that using Kali in a vm, docker, live usb, etc is &ldquo;Skid and lazy?&rdquo; because really it isn&rsquo;t. Even on my own personal machines I run EndeavourOS with Archstrike repos added. I could just download and install the tools myself, but why should I spend time doing that when I can just type <code>sudo pacman -Sy nmap</code> or something like that because <strong>time is money</strong> and I rather not have my time wasted on something so unnecessary.</p><p>So is using Kali makes you a skid or whatever people are using these days? I don&rsquo;t really understand why using a tool makes you less competent and really I think I should share my thoughts on the term &lsquo;skid&rsquo; in particular.</p><h4 id=skid-or-not>Skid or not?</h4><p>The term skid in particular has lost its meaning. It has evolved to the point that theoretically anyone is a skid regardless of their experience and skill level. Nobody can know everything so yes sometimes even the most skilled will look at documentation and go o_O over some tool or concept that they don&rsquo;t work with often or see often. We cannot do our job without documentation, notes, or cracking open a book. It is impossible to know every single tool, flag, protocol, version, port, etc.</p><p>So I guess my thoughts on &lsquo;Skid&rsquo; is simply, if you have to make your fragile ego feel better by calling someone basically stupid for being more efficient than you, you probably should change professions if you have a profession at all in the industry. Instead we should all try to be better at encouraging and teaching everyone what we know regardless if they are starting out or have spent way too much time in front of a computer. This comes from personal experience from myself from when I was a teenager. People treated me poorly. It took me a long time to grasp many things and especially writing tools that weren&rsquo;t garbage because instead of helping people let their fragile ego get in the way and treat me so poorly that I nearly quit until someone took me under his wing because they realized that I just needed direction. Thanks to him and my other friends such as Catwatch, they encouraged me a lot to code and build things while also telling me that people for the most part will attack you on anything regardless what you know which says a lot.</p><h4 id=final-thoughts>Final thoughts</h4><p>I want to close this off with something short: Don&rsquo;t listen to what other people are saying. The ones that are trying to bring you down are usually doing less. Basically do your thing, ask questions regardless if it sounds stupid or not, and just share your knowledge with other people.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
