Name: Alex/f0rg
What do I do? Eating, sleeping, computers, being boring.
What do you love? Hardware, the colors red and orange (burnt orange is bae), eating (it is the way to my heart)
Oh did I mention I love hardware? Oh I also love ducks.
I mostly shitpost on infosec.exchange at @alex_02. I also should note this is a personal account and I could care less about creating &amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo; and/or &amp;ldquo;mature&amp;rdquo; posts.</description></item><item><title>Opinion: Current Hardware Sucks</title><link>https://f0rg-02.github.io/blog/posts/current-hardware-sucks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://f0rg-02.github.io/blog/posts/current-hardware-sucks/</guid><description>DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT TO OFFEND ANYONE AND THIS IS MY OWN PRIVATE BLOG SO I WILL SAY SOMETHINGS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRIGGERING OR &amp;ldquo;UNPROFESSIONAL&amp;rdquo;.
As I stated in my [[About me]] I love hardware. I have a long list of toys that I want to buy to play with and this is probably the main reason why I am broke, but just to do a quick overview on my rant on some annoyances that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been seeing with computers and hardware.</description></item></channel></rss>
