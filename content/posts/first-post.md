Who am I (cliche I know):

Name: Alex/f0rg
What do I do? Eating, sleeping, computers, being boring.
What do you love? Hardware, the colors red and orange (burnt orange is bae), eating (it is the way to my heart)

Oh did I mention I love hardware? Oh I also love ducks.

I mostly shitpost on infosec.exchange at @alex_02. I also should note this is a personal account
and I could care less about creating "professional" and/or "mature" posts. The internet has
evolved to not be taken seriously and I rather keep it this way. I also do run: https://infosec.pub/c/hardware

Which I shitpost everything and anything about hardware. It is so broad that I could care less if somethings
don't fall properly under this category.

Anyways, I might remember to write posts on here or I might know. Whatever the direction of the wind says
or however that goes.
